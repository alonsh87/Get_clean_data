What I did in the project is read the data to R.
Then I combined the test and the training with putting the correct column names.
I added columns for the subject and the activity for easier understanding.
I removed all columnsbut  the columns with the mean and std
I changed the activity number for the name by merging the 2 data sets
Then I averaged all the variables by the activity for each subject
